The book will guide readers from the definition of the building blocks of a mobile application to its build and distribution, using code samples taken from a real project. The complete source code will be available through a GitHub repository. The aim of the book is to provide the reader with a complete overview of mobile development including some hints about backend services architecture and emerging platforms.

The book assumes a basic knowledge of the Cordova APIs, however the following APIs will be covered in details:

* Device sensors (Compass and Accelerometer)
* InAppBrowser
* Data Storage
* FileSystem

The book also covers some of the common tasks and challenges a developer can encounter when working on a mobile app including:

* Application views and templating
* Adapting views to different devices and operating systems
* Loading external data using third-party services
* Using effectively the NET interface trough a `WebView`
* Using mobile backend services (MBaaS) 
* Extending Cordova with plugins
* Using mobile device sensors
* Interacting with proximity sensors such as iBeacon and Estimote Beacons
* Implementing off-line strategies using the `WebView` cache and the device storage capabilities 
* Using silent push and background fetch to update the contents
* Writing fast and memory efficient JavaScript
* Managing source code dependencies across different Open Source projects
* Write testable code
* Automate mobile testing
* Interact with third-party sensors

Considering how fast the mobile world is evolving, the book will cover also some techniques to write apps for wearable platforms such as Tizen and the Apple Watch.
